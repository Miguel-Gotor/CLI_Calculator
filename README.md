# CLI Calculator
##  Basic Command Line Interface scientific calculator using Qt Creator Framework

Did this to learn Qt. Heavily inspired in the [Speedcrunch Calculator](https://bitbucket.org/heldercorreia/speedcrunch/src/master/)\
Icon by [Cosmin Negoita](https://icon-icons.com/icon/Command-Line/115191)

Features basic opperations such addition, subtraction, division, multiplication... but also exponentials and square roots, nest operations inside parentheses. Using a recursive descent parser, it analyzes the string of characters and divides by priority levels to solve it in order, respecting the hierarchy of operations.

It also includes the typical mathematical constants (Pi, Phi, e...).
